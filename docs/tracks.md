## Intro

Navigator contains a large collection of tracks/routes all over the country - from simple gravel roads
to places that require a more builtup vehicle.

All the tracks have been driven by Overland NZ or submitted by trusted users and are graded by their
difficulty and have as much detail as we can possibly provide to make sure you know exactly what
you're getting into.

## Grades

Tracks are broken up into three grades to help you decide which ones to tackle.

Obviously your skill level changes your opinion of the grade. The tracks are graded against the following idea

> Somebody who is new to offroading and overlanding, has a stock dual cab ute and standar sized all terrain tyres

### Gravel Road/Easy

Gravel road/nice and easy - can be tackled by most vehicles without too many issues. Think scenic drives
through the countryside.

### Medium

![Medium marker](https://overlandnavigator.co.nz/images/marker/mediumtrack.png)

A 4WD with low range may be required, more chance of running into issues, generally involves water crossings or mud.

### Hard

![Hard marker](https://overlandnavigator.co.nz/images/marker/hardtrack.png)

A 4WD with low range and clearance is highly recommended. These tracks are best not tackled alone unless you have experience.

## Where is 'x' track?

The tracks in Navigator are ones that Overland NZ and our trusted friends have logged and submitted.
There are obviously far more tracks around the country to be added as we drive them. Our goal is quality over
quantity - any track in the app contains complete details about it, photos and interest points where possible.

This means you get the best experience possible and know exactly what to expect when you head to an area.

## Can I submit tracks?

Absolutely! If you log your tracks in GPX format and want to submit them to Navigator, we'd be stoked.

You need to be on a computer to do so - jump onto the main app, [overlandnavigator.co.nz](https://overlandnavigator.co.nz), click Add
and upload your GPX file. Please fill in as many details as possible to help the approval process.

Once you've added the tracks you want [get in touch](https://overland.nz/contact-us) and we'll get the process
started! A sticker pack might sneak it's way to your house too.
